# PM Éire — Project Management Guide for Irish SMEs & Charities

> Practical, accessible, AI-first project management guidance built specifically
> for small businesses and charities working in Ireland.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Most project management content online is written for Fortune 500s. **PM Éire** is
written for the realities of Irish small business: 4-person cafés in Galway,
charities in Limerick, 2-cofounder software shops in Dublin. It's:

- **Practical** — copy-paste prompts, templates, and workflows, not theory
- **AI-first** — the main focus is how small teams integrate AI into daily work
- **Budget-aware** — free and low-cost options flagged first
- **Irish-contextual** — GDPR, charity regulator, LEO references, Irish tone
- **Accessible** — semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, captions, transcripts
- **Multi-media** — written guides, video, audio, and downloadable templates

## 🎨 Design

- **Primary palette:** Pink + White (warm, approachable, not corporate)
- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Advanced scroll-driven animations** (using the 2026-standard
  `animation-timeline: scroll()` and `view()` APIs with JS fallback):
  - Multi-layer parallax background (grid, 4 blobs, sparkles — all moving at
    different speeds on scroll)
  - Scroll-timeline-driven reveals with blur-in and scale
  - Section heads that rise and defocus as they enter view
  - Phase timeline that "fills in" as you scroll past it
  - Kanban preview that drifts upward on scroll
  - Sparkles that twinkle and drift independently
- **Micro-interactions:**
  - Button ripple effect on click (Material-style)
  - Magnetic pull on primary CTAs (buttons bend toward the cursor)
  - 3D tilt on all cards (perspective rotates on mouse position)
  - Shimmer sweep across cards on hover
  - Cursor-following glow (eased follow, grows on hoverable elements)
  - Logo wobble-and-spin on hover
  - Nav link underline grow
  - Icon slides/rotations on button hover
  - Form focus-within ring glow
  - Link underline sweep on hover
  - Stat hover lift
  - Hero stats subtle shimmer sweep
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`

## 🚫 Features Not Yet Implemented

- Real video file for the 8-minute primer (currently a styled placeholder)
- Real MP3 audio file (player simulates playback — transcript is real)

- Working newsletter backend (form validates and shows a thank-you message only)
- Blog / case studies section with real Irish SME stories
- Dark mode toggle
- Multi-language support (English / Gaeilge)

## 🗺 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Produce the 8-minute video** — script in place via the chapter list
2. **Record the 12-minute audio primer** — script is literally the transcript on `tools.html`
3. **Build out the template files** and host on Google Drive / Notion with public-copy links
4. **Add a "Case studies" section** — 3–5 short stories from real Irish SMEs
5. **Wire up the newsletter** — currently demo only; integrate with Mailchimp, Buttondown, etc.
6. **Add structured data (JSON-LD)** for SEO — especially Article and FAQPage schemas
7. **Consider a simple CMS** for blog posts (e.g. via the RESTful Table API)
8. **Accessibility audit** — run axe-core, test with screen readers
9. **Expand prompt library** — community submissions with voting
10. **Add Gaeilge version** of key pages
